# Dunno Dice

Forked (kinda) from https://jamuspsi.github.io/dunno/.  I reccomend copying your game save to a text file before refreshing the page, I will be making on the fly changes to the game that may break your save. To do this; use inspect element on chrome, navigate to 'Application' at the top of the inspect window, go to 'local storage', and double click on the text to the right of 'Dunno.current game', this is your save! Paste it into a text file or somewhere else. 

## Running local
- Install Node.js
- ```npm install -g http-server```
- ```http-server```
